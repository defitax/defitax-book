### `Cryptocurrency treated as per IRS :`
For taxation purposes, cryptocurrency is regarded as property: For taxation purposes, the IRS sees cryptocurrencies as property rather than money. This means that you must determine and disclose any capital gains or losses each time you sell or exchange cryptocurrencies.

`The purchasing, selling, and trading of cryptocurrencies are all taxable events:` Any gains or losses from the sale or exchange of cryptocurrencies must be disclosed on your tax return. Receiving cryptocurrencies in exchange for goods or services is likewise regarded as a taxable event.

`Trades between cryptocurrencies are taxable:` A taxable event is when you trade one kind of cryptocurrency for another. By comparing the fair market value of the cryptocurrency you received to the cost basis of the cryptocurrency you gave up, the capital gain or loss is determined.

`Keeping records is crucial:` You must maintain thorough records of each transaction if you want to report your cryptocurrency activities accurately. This contains the time, sum, and cryptocurrency value at the moment of the transaction.

`Depending on transaction volume, reporting requirements change:` You must fill out `IRS Form 8949 and Schedule D` to report your bitcoin transactions if you make more than $20,000 in sales and 200 or more transactions in a single calendar year.

`Penalties may apply if cryptocurrency transactions are not reported:` You risk paying fines and interest on any unpaid taxes if you fail to record cryptocurrency transactions or underreport your revenue.

`The complexity behind the crypto Tax`

Crypto tax calculation is very complex as we have scenarios where traders trade a lot many times throughout the day. Tracking the cost basis, fair market value, capital gain, or loss is a bit complicated. Our tax engine handles this complexity and makes sure that you are paying the tax that is needed to be paid.

Some background for the scenario about how we are planning to solve this. Assuming that a non-custodial wallet is being used by a user for all his transactions, it becomes a big dilemma to understand his transactions for the purpose of the tax.

He may be transferring from his one wallet to another wallet, then the tax engine needs to make sure that he is not taxed. So he may have several wallets mixed with both custodial and non-custodial wallets.
