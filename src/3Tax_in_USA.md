In the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires taxpayers to report and pay taxes on their cryptocurrency transactions. Here are some important things to know:

1.  Cryptocurrency is treated as property for tax purposes: The IRS treats cryptocurrency as property, not currency, for tax purposes. This means that each time you sell or exchange cryptocurrency, you need to calculate and report any capital gains or losses.
    
2.  Taxable events include buying, selling, and trading cryptocurrency: Anytime you sell or exchange cryptocurrency, you need to report any gains or losses on your tax return. Additionally, receiving cryptocurrency as payment for goods or services is also considered a taxable event.
    
3.  Crypto-to-crypto trades are taxable: If you exchange one type of cryptocurrency for another, it is considered a taxable event. The capital gain or loss is calculated by comparing the fair market value of the cryptocurrency you received to the cost basis of the cryptocurrency you gave up.
    
4.  Record-keeping is essential: To accurately report your cryptocurrency transactions, you need to keep detailed records of each transaction. This includes the date, amount, and value of the cryptocurrency at the time of the transaction.
    
5.  Reporting requirements vary based on transaction volume: If you have more than $20,000 in sales and 200 or more transactions in a calendar year, you need to report your cryptocurrency transactions on `IRS Form 8949 and Schedule D`.
    
6.  Failure to report cryptocurrency transactions can result in penalties: If you fail to report your cryptocurrency transactions or under-report your income, you may be subject to penalties and interest on any unpaid taxes.
    

It is important to consult with a tax professional for guidance on how to report your cryptocurrency transactions and ensure compliance with IRS regulations.

In the United States, `presumptive income` is a way to estimate the income of certain taxpayers for tax purposes. It is used in situations where the taxpayer's actual income is difficult to determine or where the taxpayer has not kept accurate records.

Here are the steps to calculate presumptive income in the United States:

1.  Determine the taxpayer's business type: Presumptive income rules vary depending on the taxpayer's business type. For example, self-employed individuals, such as freelancers and independent contractors, may be subject to different presumptive income rules than farmers or fishermen.
    
2.  Determine the applicable presumptive income rate: The IRS provides tables that show the presumptive income rates for each business type. These rates are expressed as a percentage of gross receipts or sales.
    
3.  Calculate the presumptive income: Multiply the taxpayer's gross receipts or sales by the applicable presumptive income rate. For example, if the presumptive income rate is 10% and the taxpayer's gross receipts are $100,000, the presumptive income would be $10,000 (10% of $100,000).
    

It is important to note that the use of presumptive income is optional and may not be beneficial for all taxpayers. It is also important to maintain accurate records of all business income and expenses to ensure compliance with tax regulations. It is recommended to consult with a tax professional to determine if using presumptive income is appropriate for your situation.

In the United States, capital gains are taxed at different rates depending on the taxpayer's income level and the length of time the asset was held.

1.  Short-term capital gains: Assets held for one year or less are considered short-term capital gains and are taxed at the taxpayer's ordinary income tax rate.
    
2.  Long-term capital gains: Assets held for more than one year are considered long-term capital gains and are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
    

The long-term capital gains tax rates for the tax year 2022 are:

-   0% for taxpayers with taxable income up to $40,400 for individuals, $80,800 for married filing jointly
-   15% for taxpayers with taxable income between $40,401 and $445,850 for individuals, $80,801 and $501,600 for married filing jointly
-   20% for taxpayers with taxable income over $445,850 for individuals, $501,601 for married filing jointly

It is important to note that high-income taxpayers may also be subject to an additional 3.8% net investment income tax on capital gains and other investment income.

Taxpayers should also be aware of any applicable state capital gains taxes, as these rates and rules vary by state. It is recommended to consult with a tax professional for guidance on how to accurately report and pay capital gains taxes.
