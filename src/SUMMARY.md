# Summary
```
For tax purposes, cryptocurrency is treated as property, which means that gains or losses from the sale or exchange of cryptocurrency are treated as capital gains or losses. If you keep cryptocurrency for more than a year before selling or exchanging it, you may qualify for long-term capital gains treatment, which can result in lower tax rates. Furthermore, if you receive cryptocurrency in exchange for goods or services, it is considered income and is subject to income tax. The value of the coins you receive if you mine cryptocurrency is considered income and is subject to income tax.Losses from cryptocurrency transactions can be used to offset gains from other transactions or carried forward to future years to offset future gains. To ensure compliance with applicable tax laws, it is recommended to consult with a tax professional or accountant who is knowledgeable about cryptocurrency taxation. The rules for cryptocurrency taxation can be complex and subject to change.
