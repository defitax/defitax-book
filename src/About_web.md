# About web

Although the definition of the web varies from person to person, it all begins with a movement away from the centralization of services like search engines, social media, and chat applications that are dependent on a single organization to function, which can be easily abused as countless cases demonstrate.md

The internet today has been transformed into a top-down system or surveillance capitalism dominated by a few big players whose power is derived from their control over your data.

The web initiatives advocate the possibility of data being returned to the control of the people who generate it. It is considered as a move that is going to reverse the current information and social dilemmas we are faced with and create a more frictionless and humane virtual economy.

It is an open-source project led by the Web Foundation. It is a shared protocol that connects different blockchain networks.

# Polkadot

Polkadot consists of two parts: Relaychain and Parachain.

Relaychain: This is the core of Polkadot which is responsible for the network security, consensus, and cross-chain interoperability.
Currently we have Kusama and Polkadot as the main relay chains of the DOT ecosystem.

Parachain: These are sovereign blockchains with custom tokens and optimized functionality for specific use cases. Parachain connection to Relaychain is priced on a pay-as-you-go basis or a continuous connectivity lease.

# Substrate

Substrate comes with everything you need to build your blockchain. Use Substrate's pallets to easily create what you want, or craft your own custom logic. Either way, Substrate makes building a blockchain faster, easier, and safer than ever before.

It also allows us to make changes in the future easy without having to do any hard forks, meaning that we can do the changes in our code and do a runtime upgrade without much hassle.

# SubQuery

SubQuery is the path breaking project built on the Polkadot ecosystem and provides a great indexing solution. We can use basic building blocks and can index anything happening in the blockchain(currently we are focussing on Polkadot and Kusama relay chains).

A lot of hard handling is done inside the SubQuery and we need to just write our query and expose it via simple GraphQL APIs, that can be queried from any client. The best part with Subquery is, the platform allows us to host our indexer freely as of now.

#  Tax Engine

The most important and complex part of our ecosystem is the tax engine, which has all the complex logic. The whole transactions will be fed into the tax engine and the calculations will take place here.

We have team members who are  CPA working on research each and every day to make it more and more efficient and accurate.

## Economics

The lack of research was made to understand crypto and identify it as a taxable event. But unable to identify the scenario that prevents the nontaxable event.

IRS was given notice of CP2501 and CP2000 to more than 10,000 who potentially failed to report crypto income in 2019 and so on.

The federal government is so convinced of the potential for income from back-due taxes that the White House wants to give the IRS an extra $80 billion and new powers to crack down on tax dodgers, including those parking their cash in crypto.

- Accuracy: The prices can accurately reflect market prices.
- Timeliness: The prices can react quickly to the changes in market prices.
- Globalization: The scenario was changed according to countries’ tax format and government guidelines.
- Decentralization: The price is generated and verified in a decentralized and permissionless system.
