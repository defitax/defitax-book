This documentation helps users to understand the core concepts of Defi Tax and walk through the steps required to solves the problems of decentralized tax calculation.

`Defi` tax is a decentralized tax calcuating platform built on substrate-based blockchain. We believe that the Polkadot/Substrate framework ensures an effective Defi solution than any other centralized service. Furthermore, our project is exclusively designed for managing cryptocurrencies tax to comply with the law.

We aim to provide you with a decentralized platform to stay compliant and get your crypto taxes done without third-party intervention. Cryptocurrency can be classified as an investment asset, and so it is bound to be taxed under capital gains.

Currently, there is no Defi space providing such service, and we aim to build a platform that powers the individual by giving the entire taxable calculation on their cryptocurrencies. Having said that, we thrive to make sure of handling all the hard calculations and intricacies of the tax calculation.

We want to make it more and more user friendly and a great customer experience for anyone who wants to use our system, which indeed will be a completely decentralized tax calculation system.

For our future mission we have several other aspects in the pipeline, like making your life easier to pay your taxes using our system as a one stop solution for all your tax related stuff.

We also have some utility planned for the benefit of our native token holder built as a parachain on polkadot.
