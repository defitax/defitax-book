<h3 id="cryptocurrency-treated-as-per-irs-"><a class="header" href="#cryptocurrency-treated-as-per-irs-"><code>Cryptocurrency treated as per IRS :</code></a></h3>
<p>For taxation purposes, cryptocurrency is regarded as property: For taxation purposes, the IRS sees cryptocurrencies as property rather than money. This means that you must determine and disclose any capital gains or losses each time you sell or exchange cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p><code>The purchasing, selling, and trading of cryptocurrencies are all taxable events:</code> Any gains or losses from the sale or exchange of cryptocurrencies must be disclosed on your tax return. Receiving cryptocurrencies in exchange for goods or services is likewise regarded as a taxable event.</p>
<p><code>Trades between cryptocurrencies are taxable:</code> A taxable event is when you trade one kind of cryptocurrency for another. By comparing the fair market value of the cryptocurrency you received to the cost basis of the cryptocurrency you gave up, the capital gain or loss is determined.</p>
<p><code>Keeping records is crucial:</code> You must maintain thorough records of each transaction if you want to report your cryptocurrency activities accurately. This contains the time, sum, and cryptocurrency value at the moment of the transaction.</p>
<p><code>Depending on transaction volume, reporting requirements change:</code> You must fill out <code>IRS Form 8949 and Schedule D</code> to report your bitcoin transactions if you make more than $20,000 in sales and 200 or more transactions in a single calendar year.</p>
<p><code>Penalties may apply if cryptocurrency transactions are not reported:</code> You risk paying fines and interest on any unpaid taxes if you fail to record cryptocurrency transactions or underreport your revenue.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-crypto"><a class="header" href="#what-is-crypto">what is crypto?</a></h2>
<p>Crypto tax is the tax implications for the profit generated via cryptocurrencies. Any crypto has been classified as an asset similar to the property by the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) and is taxed as such.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-taxable-events"><a class="header" href="#what-are-taxable-events">What are Taxable Events?</a></h2>
<p>Taxable events refer to the actions taken in cryptocurrencies that incur the tax.</p>
<p>Crypto sale for fiat currencies.</p>
<p>Trading crypto to crypto.</p>
<p>Using crypto for retail transactions such as the purchase or sale of goods.</p>
<p>Crypto incomes via Mining, Staking, Airdrop, Farming, etc.</p>
<p><code>Scenario 1:</code>
User A bought 1 Dot from an exchange at $100 and sells at $200. As he converted his crypto to fiat currency and hence it triggers the taxable event.</p>
<p>User A is liable to pay tax on ($200-$100) i.e. $100.</p>
<p>If User A sells the Dot at $50 which incurs the loss of $50 capital loss and this reduces the user’s taxable income.</p>
<p>Note* Tax brackets will be different depending on various factors like country, long term/short term, single/married, etc.</p>
<p><code>Scenario 2:</code>
User B purchases 10 Dot at $1000 and later on trades all 10 Dot for 5KSM at the rate when 10 Dot was worth $1500.</p>
<p>Trading crypto to crypto is a taxable event and in this scenario User, B incurs the capital gain of $500.</p>
<p><code>Scenario 3:</code>
User C bought 1 Dot at $10 and she holds that for 4 years. When she found the Dot value went to $1500 she got excited and bought a new laptop for her.</p>
<p>In this scenario, she incurs $1490 capital gain and she is liable to report this gain on her taxes.</p>
<p><code>Scenario 4:</code>
User D has 50 Dots and through farming, he made upto 25 Dot and currently he is holding 75 Dots which he sells and get ample profit.</p>
<p>At the time of buying 50 Dots, it cost the user $500. And he sold his 75 Dots at $3000 and so he got $2500 capital gain which is taxable.</p>
<p><code>The complexity behind the crypto Tax</code></p>
<p>Crypto tax calculation is very complex as we have scenarios where traders trade a lot many times throughout the day. Tracking the cost basis, fair market value, capital gain, or loss is a bit complicated. Our tax engine handles this complexity and makes sure that you are paying the tax that is needed to be paid.</p>
<p>Some background for the scenario about how we are planning to solve this. Assuming that a non-custodial wallet is being used by a user for all his transactions, it becomes a big dilemma to understand his transactions for the purpose of the tax.</p>
<p>He may be transferring from his one wallet to another wallet, then the tax engine needs to make sure that he is not taxed. So he may have several wallets mixed with both custodial and non-custodial wallets.</p>
<p><code>Our blockchain application(dApp) helped sort out this complex issue, thanks to our research team(which includes an experienced CPA and analysts) who are researching as I am typing this to improve the customer overheads.</code></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="technical"><a class="header" href="#technical">Technical</a></h1>
<pre><code>diagram
</code></pre>
<p>As per the technical architecture above, we have our user connecting to the wallet and then they can choose for the chain, it can be a relaychain like polkadot or kusama or maybe any other chains built on polkadot or kusama.</p>
<p>For the current iteration we are only focussing on polkadot and kusama which we will extend for all the other chains as well.</p>
<p>Once the wallet is connected and the chain is chosen, then they can start the tax calculation by just pressing a button which will initiate the process. As a part of the first step they need to specify all the wallets the user has.</p>
<p>Which they can do either manually or by selecting among the transactions, which our app will help to do so.</p>
<p>After doing that they will get the taxable amount which they can either use our platform to pay(future goal of integrating with the tax paying systems based on their decentralizations) or they can export and use it for paying the tax by themselves.</p>
<p>So coming to the technical how it works is we have our react app connecting to polkadot.js extension or any supported wallet. After connecting, the user starts processing, we submit an extrinsic from our pallet which will call the SubQuery GraphQL API which is built and hosted on the Subquery platform.</p>
<p>The SubQuery API will index the transactions for the DOT address from the wallet and give those transaction back to our front-end.</p>
<p>We have onFinality api behind the subquery which runs the nodes and helps us indexing the transaction based on the wallet address provided. After the successful response from subquery graphql api.</p>
<p>We fetch the information from our pallet and feed that to the tax engine.</p>
<p>Tax engine is the core component of our app which then does all the hard handling and provides us with the taxable amount with multiple options to deal further as explained above.</p>
<h1 id="substratepolkadot-integration"><a class="header" href="#substratepolkadot-integration">Substrate/Polkadot Integration</a></h1>
<p>Polkadot ecosystem and the newly-updated Substrate 2.0 are essential to what the Network is trying to achieve.</p>
<p>The network will be connected to the Polkadot ecosystem acting as a para chain, sharing the Polkadot underlying consensus, and protected by the network performance of Polkadot and Substrate.</p>
<p>Polkadot/Kusama is an important foundation, on which the Network and its components are built.</p>
<p>The pallets that come with the Substrate 2.0 upgrade can offer Network the tools and maps to navigate through our vision, which is to build an advanced decentralized oracle that offers on/off-chain data with built-in interoperability.</p>
<p>The off-chain worker is a substrate subsystem that can process off-chain data in an asynchronous way.</p>
<p>It is a new feature in Substrate Framework that allows integrating data onto the blockchain. It can make off-chain data integration secure and more efficient, which is ideal for real-world data inputs via oracles.</p>
<p>The off-chain worker subsystem allows execution of long-running and possibly non-deterministic tasks (e.g. web requests, encryption/decryption and signing of data, random number generation, CPU-intensive computations, enumeration/aggregation of on-chain data, etc.) leveraging on-chain data and access.</p>
<p>Thus, we have the Data Warehouse in the system which will deal with Date Feeds and Data Requests sent by the user in a local data store or even a decentralized data storage such as IPFS.</p>

<p>In the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires taxpayers to report and pay taxes on their cryptocurrency transactions. Here are some important things to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cryptocurrency is treated as property for tax purposes: The IRS treats cryptocurrency as property, not currency, for tax purposes. This means that each time you sell or exchange cryptocurrency, you need to calculate and report any capital gains or losses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taxable events include buying, selling, and trading cryptocurrency: Anytime you sell or exchange cryptocurrency, you need to report any gains or losses on your tax return. Additionally, receiving cryptocurrency as payment for goods or services is also considered a taxable event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crypto-to-crypto trades are taxable: If you exchange one type of cryptocurrency for another, it is considered a taxable event. The capital gain or loss is calculated by comparing the fair market value of the cryptocurrency you received to the cost basis of the cryptocurrency you gave up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Record-keeping is essential: To accurately report your cryptocurrency transactions, you need to keep detailed records of each transaction. This includes the date, amount, and value of the cryptocurrency at the time of the transaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reporting requirements vary based on transaction volume: If you have more than $20,000 in sales and 200 or more transactions in a calendar year, you need to report your cryptocurrency transactions on <code>IRS Form 8949 and Schedule D</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failure to report cryptocurrency transactions can result in penalties: If you fail to report your cryptocurrency transactions or under-report your income, you may be subject to penalties and interest on any unpaid taxes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to consult with a tax professional for guidance on how to report your cryptocurrency transactions and ensure compliance with IRS regulations.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the United States, <code>presumptive income</code> is a way to estimate the income of certain taxpayers for tax purposes. It is used in situations where the taxpayer's actual income is difficult to determine or where the taxpayer has not kept accurate records.</p>
<p>Here are the steps to calculate presumptive income in the United States:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Determine the taxpayer's business type: Presumptive income rules vary depending on the taxpayer's business type. For example, self-employed individuals, such as freelancers and independent contractors, may be subject to different presumptive income rules than farmers or fishermen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine the applicable presumptive income rate: The IRS provides tables that show the presumptive income rates for each business type. These rates are expressed as a percentage of gross receipts or sales.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculate the presumptive income: Multiply the taxpayer's gross receipts or sales by the applicable presumptive income rate. For example, if the presumptive income rate is 10% and the taxpayer's gross receipts are $100,000, the presumptive income would be $10,000 (10% of $100,000).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to note that the use of presumptive income is optional and may not be beneficial for all taxpayers. It is also important to maintain accurate records of all business income and expenses to ensure compliance with tax regulations. It is recommended to consult with a tax professional to determine if using presumptive income is appropriate for your situation.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the United States, capital gains are taxed at different rates depending on the taxpayer's income level and the length of time the asset was held.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Short-term capital gains: Assets held for one year or less are considered short-term capital gains and are taxed at the taxpayer's ordinary income tax rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Long-term capital gains: Assets held for more than one year are considered long-term capital gains and are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The long-term capital gains tax rates for the tax year 2022 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>0% for taxpayers with taxable income up to $40,400 for individuals, $80,800 for married filing jointly</li>
<li>15% for taxpayers with taxable income between $40,401 and $445,850 for individuals, $80,801 and $501,600 for married filing jointly</li>
<li>20% for taxpayers with taxable income over $445,850 for individuals, $501,601 for married filing jointly</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that high-income taxpayers may also be subject to an additional 3.8% net investment income tax on capital gains and other investment income.</p>
<p>Taxpayers should also be aware of any applicable state capital gains taxes, as these rates and rules vary by state. It is recommended to consult with a tax professional for guidance on how to accurately report and pay capital gains taxes.</p>

<p>Although the definition of the web varies from person to person, it all begins with a movement away from the centralization of services like search engines, social media, and chat applications that are dependent on a single organization to function, which can be easily abused as countless cases demonstrate.md</p>
<p>The internet today has been transformed into a top-down system or surveillance capitalism dominated by a few big players whose power is derived from their control over your data.</p>
<p>The web initiatives advocate the possibility of data being returned to the control of the people who generate it. It is considered as a move that is going to reverse the current information and social dilemmas we are faced with and create a more frictionless and humane virtual economy.</p>
<p>It is an open-source project led by the Web Foundation. It is a shared protocol that connects different blockchain networks.</p>
<h1 id="polkadot"><a class="header" href="#polkadot">Polkadot</a></h1>
<p>Polkadot consists of two parts: Relaychain and Parachain.</p>
<p>Relaychain: This is the core of Polkadot which is responsible for the network security, consensus, and cross-chain interoperability.
Currently we have Kusama and Polkadot as the main relay chains of the DOT ecosystem.</p>
<p>Parachain: These are sovereign blockchains with custom tokens and optimized functionality for specific use cases. Parachain connection to Relaychain is priced on a pay-as-you-go basis or a continuous connectivity lease.</p>
<h1 id="substrate"><a class="header" href="#substrate">Substrate</a></h1>
<p>Substrate comes with everything you need to build your blockchain. Use Substrate's pallets to easily create what you want, or craft your own custom logic. Either way, Substrate makes building a blockchain faster, easier, and safer than ever before.</p>
<p>It also allows us to make changes in the future easy without having to do any hard forks, meaning that we can do the changes in our code and do a runtime upgrade without much hassle.</p>
<h1 id="subquery"><a class="header" href="#subquery">SubQuery</a></h1>
<p>SubQuery is the path breaking project built on the Polkadot ecosystem and provides a great indexing solution. We can use basic building blocks and can index anything happening in the blockchain(currently we are focussing on Polkadot and Kusama relay chains).</p>
<p>A lot of hard handling is done inside the SubQuery and we need to just write our query and expose it via simple GraphQL APIs, that can be queried from any client. The best part with Subquery is, the platform allows us to host our indexer freely as of now.</p>
<h1 id="tax-engine"><a class="header" href="#tax-engine">Tax Engine</a></h1>
<p>The most important and complex part of our ecosystem is the tax engine, which has all the complex logic. The whole transactions will be fed into the tax engine and the calculations will take place here.</p>
<p>We have team members who are  CPA working on research each and every day to make it more and more efficient and accurate.</p>

<p>In recent years, cryptocurrency mining has grown in popularity, with many people mining for digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. However, keep in mind that mining is a taxable activity in the United States, and miners must report their mining income on their tax returns. In this article, we will go over the fundamentals of calculating cryptocurrency mining taxes.</p>
<p>Earnings from Cryptocurrency Mining The first step in calculating cryptocurrency mining taxes is to figure out how much money you make from mining. This is the amount of cryptocurrency you earned during the tax year from mining. For example, if you mined one Bitcoin during the tax year and the fair market value of that Bitcoin was $10,000 on the day it was mined, your tax liability would be $10,000.</p>
<p>Expenses for Mining Cryptocurrency Following the determination of your mining income, the next step is to compute your mining expenses. This includes any mining-related expenses such as equipment, electricity, and internet access. These costs can be deducted from your mining earnings, lowering your taxable income.</p>
<p>Costs of Equipment Mining equipment costs include the cost of any mining hardware, such as mining rigs, graphics cards, or ASICs. Depending on the value and the applicable tax rules, these costs can be depreciated over time or deducted in full in the year they were purchased.</p>
<p>Electricity Prices Because cryptocurrency mining requires a lot of computational power, electricity costs are a significant expense. The cost of mining electricity is calculated by multiplying the wattage used by the electricity rate per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Electricity expenses can be deducted on your tax return.</p>
<p>Internet Fees Miners must be connected to the internet in order to participate in the mining process, so internet costs are also incurred in cryptocurrency mining. Internet expenses can be deducted as a tax deduction on your tax return.</p>
<p>Taxes on Cryptocurrency Mining After determining your mining income and expenses, you must report your mining taxes on your tax return. Individual miners can report their mining income and expenses on Schedule C of their tax returns. Mining income and expenses can be reported on Forms 1120 or 1065 if you are a corporation or partnership.</p>
<p>Conclusion To summarise, cryptocurrency mining can be a profitable activity; however, it is also a taxable activity in the United States. Cryptocurrency miners must report their mining earnings and expenses on their tax returns. By correctly calculating and reporting mining income and expenses, cryptocurrency miners can reduce their tax liability and avoid potential penalties for failing to report mining income. To ensure compliance with the applicable tax laws, it is recommended that you seek the assistance of a tax professional who is knowledgeable about cryptocurrency taxation.</p>
